     *
     *  donâ€™t know how you feel about doing algorithmic questions. I have concluded that the skill of doing algorithmic questions is to refine the big problem to a point, first study how to solve the problem on this small point, and then use recursion/iteration extended to the whole problem.
     *
     * For example, our previous article Take you hand in hand to brush the third phase of the binary tree, To solve the problem of the binary tree, we will refine the whole problem to a certain node, imagine ourselves standing on a certain node, what needs to be done, and then set the binary tree recursive framework.
     *
     * The same is true for dynamic programming series problems, especially those related to subsequences. This article starts from the "longest common subsequence problem", summarizes the three subsequence problems , solves this problem and carefully explains the routine of this subsequence problem, and you can feel this way of thinking.

     * The definition of this dp function is dp(s1, i, s2, j) to s1[i..]calculate s2[j..]the length of the longest common subsequence.
     *
     * According to this definition, the answer we want is dp(s1, 0, s2, 0), and the base case is i == len(s1)or j == len(s2), because at this time s1[i..]or s2[j..]is equivalent to an empty string, and the length of the longest common subsequence is obviously 0:
     *
     * Next, let's not look s1at s2the two strings of and , but to be specific to each character and think about what each character should do .
     * We only look at s1[i]and s2[j], if s1[i] == s2[j], it means that this character must be in lcs,
     * s1[i] != s2[j]what should I do if it happens?
     * s1[i] != s2[j]means, s1[i]and s2[j]have at least one character that is not lcsin :
