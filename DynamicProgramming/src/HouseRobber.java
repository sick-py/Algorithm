     * robbery 1 198
     * There is a row of houses on the street, nums represented , and each element represents nums[i] the amount of cash in the house. iNow you are a professional thief, you want to steal as much cash as possible from these houses, however, adjacent houses cannot be stolen at the same time , otherwise the alarm will be triggered and you will be left alone.
     *
     * For example nums=[2,1,7,9,3,1], input, the algorithm returns 12, the thief can steal nums[0], nums[3], nums[5]three houses, and the sum of cash obtained is 2 + 9 + 1 = 12, which is the optimal choice.
     *
     * The topic is easy to understand, and the characteristics of dynamic programming are obvious. We have summarized in the previous article "Detailed Explanation of Dynamic Programming". To solve the dynamic programming problem is to find "state" and "choice", that's all .
     *
     * Imagine that you are the professional robber, walking through this row of houses from left to right, and there are two choices in front of each house : to rob or not to rob.
     * If you rob this house, then you must not be able to rob the next adjacent house, and you can only choose from the next house.
     *
     * If you don't grab this house, then you can go to the next house and continue to make choices.
     *
     * When you have passed the last house, you don't have to grab it, and the money you can grab is obviously 0 ( base case ).
     *
     * The above logic is very simple. In fact, the "state" and "choice" have been clarified: the index of the house in front of you is the state, and whether to grab or not is the choice .

     * Robbers still cannot rob adjacent houses, and the input is still an array, but tell you that these houses are not in a row, but in a circle .
     *
     * That is to say, now the first house and the last house are also equivalent to being adjacent and cannot be robbed at the same time. For example, if you input an array nums=[2,3,2], the result returned by the algorithm should be 3 instead of 4, because the beginning and the end cannot be robbed at the same time.
     *
     * First of all, the first and last rooms cannot be robbed at the same time, so there are only three different situations: either none of them are robbed; or the first room is robbed and the last room is not robbed;
     * That's simple, in these three situations, which one has the greatest result is the final answer! However, in fact, we donâ€™t need to compare the first situations, we just need to compare the second situations and the third situations, because the choice of the house in these two situations is larger than that in the other situation, and the money in the house is a non-negative number, so there is more choice , the optimal decision result will definitely be bigger .
