     *
     * In fact, Dijkstra and BFS algorithms are similar, but before explaining the Dijkstra algorithm framework, we first need to modify the previous framework as follows:
     * Find a way to get rid of the for loop inside the while loop.
     * Why? With the foreshadowing just now, it is not difficult to understand, what is the use of the cycle just now?
     * It is to let the binary tree traverse down layer by layer, so that the BFS algorithm spreads outward step by step, because this number of layers, or this number of steps, is useful in the previous scene.

     * But now we want to solve the shortest path problem in the "weighted graph", the "number of steps" has no reference meaning, and the "sum of the weights of the path" is meaningful, so this for cycle can be removed.
     *
     * How to remove? Take the hierarchical traversal of binary trees, in fact, you can directly remove the loop-related code:for
