public class InorderSuccessorBST {
    /**
     * Write a method to find the in-order successor of a BST node with a given value. Return -1 if the node with the given value does not exist.
     *
     * The in-order successor of a node in a BST is the node with the smallest key greater than the key of the current node. This is the same as the next node in an in-order traversal of the BST.
     *
     * Find the node with the same value as the given value. If no such node is found, return a node with a value of -1.
     * If the node with the given value has a right child, then the left-most child in the right childâ€™s subtree is the in-order successor. This successor would also be the child with the minimum value in that subtree.
     *
     * If the node with the given value has no right child, then the in-order successor is the node with a minimum value, higher than the given value, in the parent chain of the node with the given value. This is updated as we move through the BST.
     *
     * If we find no such node in steps 2 and 3, the in-order successor does not exist. In other words, the given value is the highest value stored in the tree. Return NULL in this case.
     * Note: We only update or assign the successor when we move towards a left child node while looking for the input node.
