     * The further apart these two bars are, the more the area of the container is.

     * We use two markers, left and right, representing the height arrayâ€™s start and end, respectively. We also use a variable to keep track of the maximum area.
     *
     * Here is the optimized algorithm we use:
     *
     * Initialize the left and right markers with the two outermost exterior bars and the maximum area as zero.
     * Now, we iterate through the lines by moving the shortest height bar inwards until we find the maximum area.
     * After each iteration, we update the maximum area if we found a larger area container is found.
     * We stop iterating once the two bars pass each other.
